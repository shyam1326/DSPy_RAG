# DSPY - Programming Foundation Model - Inbuilt Chain of Thought Prompting

## Description
DSPY (Declarative Self-improving Language Programs) is a programming foundation model designed to address common issues in retrieval and response generation. It features advanced techniques for auto prompt optimization, auto reasoning, pipeline adaptation, auto weight optimization, and built-in evaluation to ensure optimal performance and accuracy.

## Key Components
1. **Signature:** Focuses on the type of system being built (e.g., Q&A, Chatbot).
2. **Modules:** Involves advanced prompting techniques and LLM models.
3. **Optimizer:** Automatically evaluates responses and retrieved-context against the ground truth.

## Features
- **Auto Prompt Optimization:** Automatically enhances the prompts for better results.
- **Auto Reasoning:** Implements automated reasoning to improve decision-making.
- **Pipeline Adaptation:** Seamlessly integrates into existing pipelines.
- **Auto Weight Optimization:** Automatically adjusts weights for optimal performance.
- **Built-in Evaluation:** Features built-in mechanisms for evaluating responses.

## Challenges Addressed
**Retrieval Issues:**
1. Inadequate retrieval coverage.
2. Retrieval of irrelevant information.
3. Bias in retrieval.
4. Fixing all the above individually is a tedious process.

**LLM Response Issues:**
1. Lack of context relevance.
2. Inconsistent and incoherent responses.
3. Poor quality and inaccuracy.
4. Inability to adapt to context changes.

## Why DSPY?
DSPY tackles these issues head-on with its innovative features:
1. Auto Prompt Optimization: Automatically enhances the prompts for better results.
2. Auto Reasoning: Implements automated reasoning to improve decision-making.
3. Pipeline Adaptation: Seamlessly integrates into existing pipelines.
4. Auto Weight Optimization: Automatically adjusts weights for optimal performance.
5. Built-in Evaluation: Features built-in mechanisms for evaluating responses.
